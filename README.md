What is Bit Vector?

-Bit Vector is the most memory efficient way to store the ON/OFF state of any number of objects.
-In this vector ON state is represented by 1 and OFF state is represented by 0.
-Instead of creating a vector of ints to store 0 or 1 for each object and allocating memory of 
 atleast 32 bits for each object instead we create a vector of bits and each bit stores the state 
 of each object. Hence we reduce the memory requirement by about 1/32 times.
